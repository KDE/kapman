    <p>
      Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must run through the maze to eat all pills without being captured by a ghost.
      By eating an energizer, Kapman gets the ability to eat ghosts for a few seconds.
      When a stage is cleared of pills and energizer the player is taken to the next stage with slightly
      increased game speed.
